Current data structure type we are designing the algorithm around. Starting with what the professr put up in class.


typedef struct literal{
	//Variable read from file
	int id;
	//Is positive if true 
	int is_pos;
}literal;

typedef struct clause{
	int len;
	 literal *lits;
}clause;

typedef struct formula{
	int num_clauses;
	clause *clauses;
}formula;
